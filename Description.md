Streamline your Boolean logic operations with a powerful program that generates Truth Tables for expressions featuring up to 4 unique variables. This Java program makes it easy to identify patterns and simplify circuits. In addition to Truth Tables, the program produces Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) expressions to simplify complex Boolean expressions. With the ability to reduce complex circuits to simpler expressions, the program offers a powerful advantage in optimizing logic operations.

The program is developed in Java and implemented using ArrayList.

*This program was a class project for the CSC-233(Computer Foundations) course.
